![[Calamity picture.jpg]]
A sound of thunder followed by a kaleidoscope of colors runs through the town on a late summer night changing existence as it flows. Just as quickly as the energy appears it vanishes leaving strange effects to the people of Union Gap. 

Side Affects:
- [[Metamorphosis]]
- [[Unexpected Guests]] 
- [[Mysterious Creature Sightings]]
- [[The Crash]]







Multiple planes of existence intersected at random points across the globe, causing varying affects across the town.
