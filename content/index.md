title: Welcome to the Campaign Wiki

Right now this is very much a WIP, but this should enable y'all to read through some backstory info and reference some items quickly

Eventually [[01. Welcome to Union Gap]] will be the homepage of the wiki, but for now it's pretty blank.

A good place to start if you actually want some story beats is [[The night the world changed]]
